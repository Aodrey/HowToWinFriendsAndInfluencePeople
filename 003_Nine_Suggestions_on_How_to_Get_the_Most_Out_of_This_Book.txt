Nine Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of This Book
本書を最大限に生かすための9つの提案

1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite, a thousand rules on how to study will avail little, And if you do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.

1. 本書を最大限に生かそうと思ったら、絶対に外せない必須条件が1つあります。これはどんなルールやテクニックよりもはるかに重要なことです。この基本的な条件を守らなければ、勉強方法が千あったって少ししか役立たなくなります。本当にこの基本的な行動を守れば、本書を最大限に生かすほかの提案を読まなくても、奇蹟を手にすることができます。

What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.

その魔法の提案とはなんでしょうか。学ぶことへの深く猛烈な要求です。対人技術を伸ばそうという固い決断です。

How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: "My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people."

どうすればそんな気持ちを高められるでしょうか。常に本書で紹介する原則がとても大事だということを思い出すことです。本書をマスターすれば、豊かで満ち足りた、幸福で充実した人生を送る助けになると心に思い描いてください。何度も自分に言い聞かせるのです。「わたしの人気、幸福、そして価値観は、少なからずわたしの対人技術次第である」と。

# these principles＝この本全部の内容のこと？

2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird's-eye
view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don't - unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading because you want to increase your skill in human relations, then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.

2. 各章は最初にざっと読んで鳥瞰してください。次の章に急ぐことに誘惑されてしまうでしょうが、楽しみのために読んでいるのでもないなら、次の章に行くのは待ってください。人間関係のスキルを高めるために読んでいるのなら、各章を戻ってもう一度じっくり読んでください。長い目で見れば、時間を節約して結果が出すことになります。

# 全部をざっと読めと言っているのではなく、あくまで各章をざっと読む→じっくり読むで2度ずつ読めって言ってるんだよな？それって鳥瞰なの？

3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.

3. 頻繁に立ち止まって読んでいる内容について熟考してください。提案の1つ1つについて、いつどのように生かすか、自分に問いただしてください。

4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand. When you come across a suggestion that you feel you can use, draw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence or highlight it, or mark it with "****." Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.

4. クレヨン、鉛筆、ペン、マーカーや蛍光ペンなどを手にして読んでください。これは使えると思った提案に出会ったら、その横に印をしておきます。四つ星級の提案だったら全文に下線を引くか、"****"といった印をつけてください。本に印をしたり下線を引いたりすると、より興味がわくし、ざっと見直すのがずいぶん楽になります。

5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of the same contracts over month after month, year after year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was the only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind. I once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I had to keep going back over it from time to time in order to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with which we forget is astonishing.

5. ある知り合いの女性が15年ほど大きな保険会社の事業所長をやっていました。毎月、その女性はその月に自社が発行したすべての保険契約書に目を通していました。そう、彼女は大量の全く同じ契約書を毎月毎月読んでいたのです。なぜかというと、経験上、繰り返し読むことだけが、約定をはっきりと心に留めておける唯一の方法だったからです。わたしはかつてほぼ2年かけてスピーチについての本を書きましたが、自分の本で何を書いたのか思い出すために、時折読み直しているほどです。人がものを忘れる時のスピードといったら驚くばかりです。

So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don't imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month, Keep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of these principles can be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is no other way.

なので、本当の、長続きする利益を本書から引き出そうと思ったら、一度ざっと読むだけで十分だと思わないことです。一通り読んだら、毎月2～3時間は復習する必要があります。毎日机上の目のつくところに置くこと。しょっちゅう目に留めること。まだ沖合に沈んでいるであろう、これから上昇する豊かな可能性に、思いをはせ続けること。本書の内容を習慣的に有用なものにするためには、復習と適用を、絶え間なく、精力的に推し進めるしかないのです。ほかに方法はないのです。

6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: "If you teach a man anything, he will never learn." Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in this book, do something about them. Apply these rules at every opportunity. If you don't you will forget them quickly. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.

6. バーナード・ショーはかつて言いました。「人に教えようとすると、決して習得はしない」と。これはその通りです。習得というのは活動的な作業です。僕たちはみな、行動により習得するのです。だから本書で学習した内容を絶対にマスターしたいと思ったら、何か行動を起こすことです。あらゆる機会で本書の内容を適用すること。そうしないとすぐに忘れてしまうでしょう。使った知識だけが、心に焼き付くのです。


You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are displeased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand the other person's viewpoint. It is frequently easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what vou want than to talk about what the other person wants. And so on, So, as you read this book, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application.

本書の内容を常に適用しようとすると、おそらくは難しいことがわかるでしょう。僕がこの本を書いたのだから保障します。僕自身も自分が提案したことなのに、全部を実現しようとすると難しいことがしょっちゅうです。たとえば、他人の立場を理解しようという気持ちになっている時よりも、イライラしているときのほうが人をとがめたり非難したりしてしまいがちです。


So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on human relations; and whenever you are confronted with some specific problem - such as handling a child, winning your spouse to your way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated customer - hesitate about doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing. This is usually wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you have underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve magic for you.

7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.

8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had become one of the most important financiers in America, and he confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I'll put it in his own words as accurately as I can remember.

"For years I have kept an engagement book showing
all the appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself:

‘What mistakes did I make that time?' ‘What did I do that was right-and in what way could I have improved my performance?' ‘What lessons can I learn from that experience?'

"I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.

"It helped me improve my ability to make decisions - and it aided me enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it too highly."

Why not use a similar system to check up on your application of the principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.

First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is both intriguing and priceless.

Second, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with people will grow enormously.

9. You will find at the end of this book several blank pages on which you should record your triumphs in the application of these principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be when you chance upon them some evening years from now!

In order to get the most out of this book:
a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations,

b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.

c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.

d. Underscore each important idea.

e. Review this book each month.

f . Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.

g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.

h. Check up each week on the progress you are mak-ing. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.

i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have applied these principles.
