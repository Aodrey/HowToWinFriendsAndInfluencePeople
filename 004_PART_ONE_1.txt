1 "IF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON'T KICK OVER THE BEEHIVE"

1 はちみつが欲しくてもハチの巣を蹴り返すな

On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever known had come to its climax. After weeks of search, "Two Gun" Crowley - the killer, the gunman who didn't smoke or drink - was at bay, trapped in his sweetheart's apartment on West End Avenue.

1931年5月7日、ニューヨーク市で知られる限り最もセンセーショナルな犯人追跡劇が山場を迎えた。何週間もの追跡の末、"2丁拳銃のクロウリー"ー喫煙も飲酒もしない殺人者ーは、ウエスト・エンド・アベニューにある恋人のアパートに追い込められた。

One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the "cop killer," with teargas. Then they mounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York's fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an over- stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.

150人もの警官隊と刑事が、犯人が潜伏する最上階を取り囲んだ。屋根に穴を開け、"警官泣かせ"のクロウリーを催涙ガスで燻し出そうとした。そして建物の周囲にぐるりと機関銃を設置し、1時間以上、ニューヨークの高級住宅街の1角は、ピストルの発砲音と機関銃の射撃音が鳴り響いた。クラウリーは張りぐるみの椅子の陰に潜み、絶え間なく警官に発砲した。1万人の人々が興奮してこの撃ち合いを見学した。ニューヨークの歩道ではこのようなことは今までに見られなかった。

When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. "He will kill," said the Commissioner, "at the drop of a feather."

クラウリーが逮捕されると、警察本部長エドワード・P・マルルーニーは、犯人がニューヨーク史上もっとも危険な犯罪者の一人であることを公表した。「奴は」と、警察本部長は言った。「針の先ほどのきっかけでも人を殺す。」

# The gunman will kill at the drop of a feather.　その殺し屋は、針の先ほどのきっかけでも人を殺す。（http://bridge2005.blog.so-net.ne.jp/2008-12-20）

But how did "Two Gun" Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed "To whom it may concern, " And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said: "Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm."

しかし"二丁拳銃"クラウリーは、自分自身をどう思っていたのだろうか。警官が彼の潜むアパートを銃撃している間、彼は、「ご迷惑をおかけしました皆様へ」と宛てた手紙を書いた。この時、彼の傷口から溢れた血が、便箋に赤い痕跡を残した。この手紙でクラウリーは書いている。「わたしのコートの下には、疲れた、でも優しい心がある。わたしの心はもう誰も傷つけたくない。」

A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said: "Let me see your license."

この事件の少し前、クラウリーは、ロングアイランドの田舎道でガールフレンドといちゃついていた。突然警官が車に歩いてきて、免許を見せてくださいと言った。

Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer's revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said: "Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.'

クラウリーは何も言わずに拳銃を出して鉛の雨を浴びせ、警官を倒した。警官が死んで倒れていくまさにその時、クラウリーは車から飛び出し、警官の拳銃を掴んでうつぶせになった身体にさらに一発銃弾を打ち込んだ。この殺人鬼が同じ口で言ったのだ。「わたしのコートの下には、疲れた、でも優しい心がある。わたしの心はもう誰も傷つけたくない。」

Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say, "This is what I get for killing people"? No, he said: "This is what I get for defending myself."

クラウリーは電気椅子で死刑となった。シンシン刑務所の死刑囚棟に到着した彼が言ったことは「人殺しをしたからこうなった」だろうか。違う。彼は「自分を守った結果こうなった」と言ったのだ。

The point of the story is this: "Two Gun" Crowley didn't blame himself for anything.

この話で注目すべきは、"2丁拳銃"のクラウリーは、自分は何も責められることはないと思っていたことである。

Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:

犯罪者としてはありえない態度だろうか。もしそう思うなら、この言葉を聞いて欲しい。

"I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man."

「わたしは人々が良い時間を過ごすのを助け、つつましい喜びを与えるために、人生最良の時を使ってきた。その結果わたしはそしりを受け、追われてやつれた男がいるだけとなった。」

That's Al Capone speaking. Yes, America's most notorious Public Enemy- the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn't condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor - an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.

これはアル・カポネの言葉だ。そう、最も悪名高い公衆の敵、かつてシカゴを荒らしまわった最も邪悪なギャングの頭だ。カポネは自分が罪を犯しているなどとは思わなかった。おそらく市民の慈善家だと思っていただろう。人々からは感謝されず、理解もされていない慈善家だと。

# アル・カポネ 1899年1月17日 - 1947年1月25日）は、アメリカのギャング。
# who ever shot up Chicagoがわからない。shoot up Chicagoでシカゴを撃ちまくったという意味？

And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of New York's most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he believed it.

ダッチ・シュルツが、ニューアークのギャングの銃弾に崩れる前に言ったことも同じだ。ダッチ・シュルツはニューヨークの最も悪名高い悪者だが、新聞のインタビューで自分が市民の偽善家だと言っているのだ。そして本人は信じ切っていた。

# ダッチ・シュルツは、1920年代から1930年代にニューヨークで活動したギャング。

I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York's infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that "few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all."

私は、ニューヨークの暗部、シンシン刑務所で長年刑務所長をしていたルイス・E・ローズと、このことでいくらかの興味深い手紙のやりとりをしたことがある。ローズ氏は「シンシンの服役者で自分が悪者と思っているのは少数だ。奴らは君やわたしと同じ平凡な人間だ。だから奴らは理屈をつけて正当化する。なぜ金庫破りをする必要があったのか、なぜ性急に撃たなければならなかったのかを言い出す。ほとんどの者が、間違っていようがいまいが一見論理的な形で、その反社会的な行動を正当化する。自分自身に対してまでも。だから自分は投獄される理由は全くないと断固として主張するのだ。」

# Lewis Edward Lawes (September 13, 1883 – April 23, 1947) was a prison warden and a proponent of prison reform. During his 21-year tenure at Sing Sing Correctional Facility, he supervised the executions of 303 prisoners.

If Al Capone, "Two Gun" Crowley, Dutch Schultz,
and the desperate men and women behind prison walls don't blame themselves for anything - what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?

アル・カポネ、"二丁拳銃"クラウリー、ダッチ・シュルツ、それに刑務所の壁の向こう側にいるどうしようもない人々が、自分自身を何についても責めないと仮定しよう。するとわたしたちが出くわす人々はどうだろうか。

John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed: "I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence."

ジョン・ワナメイカーは、自身の名を冠した百貨店の創業者であるが、一度こう告白したことがある。「30年も前に、わたしはしかりつけることはばかげているとわかったよ。神が知性の賜物を公平に分配するおつもりがないらしいという事実に思い悩むまでもなく、わたしは自分の限界を克服するのにじゅうぶんなトラブルを抱ているんだ。」

# ジョン・ワナメーカーはペンシルバニア州フィラデルフィア出身の百貨店経営者、宗教指導者、政治家。「マーケティングにおける先駆者」ともいわれる。アメリカで郵政長官も務めた。

Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third of a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.

ワナメーカーは早くからこのことに気づいたが、わたし個人は世の中を30年もへまをしてまわるはめになった。それから100人中99人の人が、どんなに間違っていようとも自分自身を批判しないのだということがうっすらとわかってきた。

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

批判は役に立たない。人を身構えさせるし、更にたいていその人は自分を正当化しようと批判に対抗する。批判は危険でもある。なぜなら大切なプライドを傷つけ、重要性を害し、そして恨みを増幅させる。

B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.

世界的に有名な心理学者のバラス・スキナーは、自身の実験で、良い行動を褒められた動物は、悪い行動を叱られた動物よりもより速く学び、学んだことをはるかに効果的に覚えていることを証明した。のちの研究で人間にも同様に当てはまることが明らかになった。批判では永久に変わることはできず、しばしば恨みをも生むのだ。

# バラス・フレデリック・スキナーはアメリカ合衆国の心理学者で行動分析学の創始者。

Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation,"

別の偉大な心理学者、ハンス・セリエはこう言っている。「人は承認を渇望すると、同じだけ非難を恐れる。」

# ハンス・セリエは、ハンガリー系カナダ人の生理学者。ストレス学説を唱え、ストレッサーの生体反応を明らかにした。

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

批判が生み出した恨みは、従業員、家族や友人のやる気をくじく可能性があり、それなのに非難されたという状況を訂正することはできない。

George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company, One of his re-sponsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the hats.

オクラホマ州イーニドのジョージ・ジョンストンは、技術系企業の安全コーディネーターである。ジョージの職務の一つは、技師が仕事をしている時にヘルメットをかぶっているかを見張ることだ。ヘルメットをかぶっていない労働者を見るやすぐに報告を上げ、長々と規則を挙げて従うよう言った。その結果、技師たちは不機嫌になり、ジョージがその場からいなくなるとすぐにヘルメットを取るようになった。

He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.

ジョージは違う方法を試すことを決めた。その後ヘルメットをかぶっていない労働者を見かけると、ヘルメットの付け心地が悪いのか、サイズが合っていないのではないかと尋ねた。それから明るい調子で、ヘルメットは怪我から身を守るように設計されていることを伝え、仕事中はずっとかぶっていてはどうかと提案した。すると、結果的には恨みや怒りの感情なしで規則が守られることが多くなった。

You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a thousand pages of history, Take, for example, the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft - a quarrel that split the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the flow of history. Let's review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican party carried only two states - Vermont and Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.

批判が無用であることの例は、歴史の何千ページにもわたって林立している。たとえば、セオドア・ルーズベルトとウィリアム・タフトとの間の論争が有名だ。この論争は共和党を2分し、ウッドロウ・ウィルソンをホワイトハウスに送り込み、第一次世界大戦に対して大胆で聡明な一線を引くことで、歴史の流れを変えた。この事実をざっと復習してみよう。セオドア・ルーズベルトが1908年にホワイトハウスを後にし、大統領に選出されたウィリアム・タフトのサポートに当たった。それからセオドア・ルーズベルトはライオン狩りにアフリカに旅立った。戻ると、彼は激怒した。彼はタフトの保守主義を公に非難し、3度目となる大統領候補を自ら確保しようと、革新党（通称：ブルムース党）を形成し、次の選挙では共和党をほとんど解体させた。ウィリアム・タフトと共和党は、バーモント州とユタ州、たった2つの州でしか勝てなかったのだ。共和党にとってこれまででもっとも破滅的な敗北である。

# Bull Moose party＝革新党（通称：ブルムース党）
# GOP. Group Of Pictures · アメリカ合衆国の共和党（Grand Old Party）の一般的な呼び方。


# セオドア “テディ”・ルーズベルトは、アメリカ合衆国の軍人、政治家で、第25代副大統領および第26代大統領である。
# ウィリアム・ハワード・タフトは、第27代アメリカ合衆国大統領および第10代アメリカ合衆国最高裁判所長官。
# トーマス・ウッドロウ・ウィルソンは、アメリカ合衆国の政治家、政治学者であり、第28代アメリカ合衆国大統領である。

Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame himself? Of course not, With tears in his eyes, Taft said: "I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have."

セオドア・ルーズベルトはタフトを非難した。しかしタフト大統領は自信を非難しただろうか？当然しない。目に涙を浮かべてタフトは言った。「自分のやり方以外では、どうすればいいかわからなかったんだ」。

Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don't know, and I don't care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt's criticism didn't persuade Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes: "I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have."

誰が責められるべきだったのだろうか？ルーズベルトか、タフトか。実のところわたしには分からないしどうでもいい。わたしがポイントとしたいのは、セオドア・ルーズベルトの批判は、タフトに自分は間違っていましたと納得させられなかったことだ。タフトは単に自分の正当化に固執し、目に涙を浮かべてこう繰り返し言ったのだ。「自分のやり方以外では、どうすればいいかわからなかったんだ」。

Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing with indignation in the early 1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men,
nothing like it had ever happened before in American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding's cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome - oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a "loan" of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court - and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.

それから、ティーポット・ドーム事件も例としてあげられる。1920年代初頭、新聞は怒りとともにこの事件を報道し続けた。この事件は国家を揺るがした！生きている人の記憶の限り、アメリカ政財界史上このようなことは起こったことがなかったのだ。事件のあらましは以下のようになる：ハーディング大統領内閣の内務長官、アルバート・B・フォールは、エルク・ヒル油田とティーポット・ドーム油田に埋蔵されている政府の石油の賃貸契約を任されていた。この石油は将来海軍が使用できるように確保し、備蓄しているものだ。フォール長官は競争入札を行ったのだろうか。いいえみなさん、長官はこのおいしい契約をまるまる、友人のエドワード・L・ドヒニーに手渡したのだ。そしてドヒニーは何をしたのかというと、フォール長官に「賃貸料」として10万ドルを渡したのだ。そして、強引にもフォール長官は、アメリカ海兵隊をこの地域に入らせ、競合他社を追い出しにかかった。この競合会社に隣接した源泉がエルク・ヒル油田から埋蔵石油を徐々に奪っていた。銃と銃剣とを突き付けられて追い出されたこれらの企業が法廷に駆け込み、ティーポット・ドーム事件として世間に暴露したわけだ。 汚職の腐敗臭がのぼり、ハーディイング陣営をだめにして、国家全体を唾棄すべきものになり下げ、共和党崩壊の恐怖にさらした。そして、アルバート・B・フォールは刑務所の檻の中に送られた。

Fall was condemned viciously - condemned as few men in public life have ever been. Did he repent? Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding's death had been due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed: "What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified."

フォールの悪事は糾弾された。公人としてきわめてまれなほどに糾弾された。フォールは後悔しただろうか？していない！数年後、第31代大統領のハーバート・フーヴァーは、ハーディング大統領の死が、友人が彼を裏切ったことによる精神的な不安や心配が原因であったと公のスピーチで言った。フォール夫人がこのことを聞くと椅子から飛び上がった。夫人は泣き、運命にこぶしを振り、叫んだ。「なんですって！ハーディングがフォールに裏切られた？とんでもない！わたしの夫は誰も裏切らなかった。我が家はお金がたくさんあるし夫に間違ったことなどさせません。夫は裏切られた側だし、虐殺され、はりつけにされたんですよ」

There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that. So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let's remember Al Capone, "Two Gun" Crowley and Albert Fall. Let's realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let's realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: "I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have."

また始まった。人間の行動の本質だ。不届き者は周囲を非難してまわるが自分自身は決して非難しない。我々は皆そうなのだ。だから、あなたも私も、明日誰かを非難するつもりなら、アル・カポネを、"二丁拳銃"クラウリーを、そしてアルバート・フォールを思い出すことだ。批判は帰巣する鳩のようなものだと認識すべきだ。批判はいつも帰ってくる。我々が訂正し、批判する相手は、おそらくその相手を正すだろうが、お返しに自分たち自身も批判する。あるいは、優しいタフト氏のように、「自分のやり方以外では、どうすればいいかわからなかったんだ」と言ってくるだろう。
# この出だし、やはりしゃべっているように訳したほうが良いのかも。

On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street from Ford's Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln's long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur's famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.

1865年4月15日の朝、アブラハム・リンカーンは、フォード劇場の真向かいにある安宿の広間のベッドに横たえられ、死んでいくところだった。フォード劇場で、ジョン・ウィルクス・ブースがリンカーンを撃ったのだ。リンカーンの身体は、その長身に対しては短すぎるたわんだベッドに、対角線上に横たえられていた。ローザ・ボヌールによる有名な「馬の市」の粗悪な複写画がベッドの上にかかっており、陰鬱なガス灯が黄色い光をまたたかせていた。

# フォード劇場は、アメリカ合衆国首都ワシントンD.C.にある現行の劇場の名称。ワシントンD.C.の10番ストリート511番地、NWに位置し、種々の興行に使用される。劇場は1865年4月14日に当時のアメリカ合衆国大統領であったエイブラハム・リンカーンの暗殺現場となったことで一躍有名となった。
＃ ジョン・ウィルクス・ブースは、アメリカ合衆国の俳優。エイブラハム・リンカーンの暗殺者として有名。南北戦争の結果に不満を持つ、南部連合の支持者であった。

As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, "There lies the most perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen."

リンカーンが死の床にある時、陸軍長官のスタントンは、「世界でも稀に見るもっとも完璧な支配者が横たわっている」と言った。

# エドウィン・マクマスターズ・スタントンは、アメリカ合衆国の政治家、法律家。1860年から1861年まで第25代アメリカ合衆国司法長官を、1862年から1868年まで第27代アメリカ合衆国陸軍長官を務めた。

What was the secret of Lincoln's success in dealing with people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of Lincoln's personality and home life as it is possible for any being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln's method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be found. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.

リンカーンが人を扱う上での成功の秘訣は何だったのだろう。私は10年の間アブラハム・リンカーンの一生を研究し、そのうちの3年を「知られざるリンカーン」というタイトルの本の執筆や書き直しに費やした。私は、リンカーンの人柄や家庭での暮らしについて、出来る限り詳細で徹底的な研究をしたと自負している。リンカーンが人とうまくやる方法を特別に研究した。リンカーンが好きなだけ批判をしていただろうか。実はそうなのだ。インディアナ州のピジョンクリーク湖にいた若い頃、リンカーンは批判しただけではなく、人をあざける手紙や詩を書いて、わざと見つかるように田舎道に落とした。この時の手紙の一つは鬱積した恨みを再燃させ、生涯に渡って燃えたものだ。

Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this just once too often.

リンカーンはイリノイ州スプリングフィールドで弁護士として開業したあとでさえ、公然と反対派を攻撃する手記を新聞に載せた。よせばいいのにとはいえ、やったのは1回だけだった。

In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln lamned him through an anonymous letter published in Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter. Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation. He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse, started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln didn't want to fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn't get out of it and save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had very long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.

1842年の秋、リンカーンはある自惚れた好戦的な政治家を、ジェームス・シールズという名義で嘲った。スプリングフィールド・ジャーナルに匿名で手記を載せ、痛烈に風刺したのだ。街じゅうが笑いの渦になった。

# lamned が辞書に載っていない。lamned ⇒lampooned 風刺した　

That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln's life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.

Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn - McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade - blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these incompetent generals, but Lincoln, "with malice toward none, with charity for all," held his peace. One of his favorite quotations was "Judge not, that ye be not judged."

And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: "Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances."

Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln. Let's take just one illustration:

The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn't escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity- the opportunity to capture Lee's army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.

And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of Lincoln's orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of
excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.

Lincoln was furious, " What does this mean?" Lincoln cried to his son Robert. "Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself."

In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter. And remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.

My dear General,

I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection With our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few- no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.

What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?

Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found among his papers after his death.

My guess is - and this is only a guess - that after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, "Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my
ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn't be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade's timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army."

So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.

Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted with a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White House and ask himself, "What would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he solve this problem?"

The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, /let's pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln's picture on the bill, and ask. "How would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?"

Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned the Paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: "The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I will see that you get it." On another occasion he wrote to an editor about a proofreader's attempts to "improve my spelling and punctuation." He ordered: "Set the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain."

The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn't do any real harm, because Mark's wife secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never sent.

Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in
favor of it, But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others - yes, and a lot less dangerous. "Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof," said Confucius, "when your own doorstep is unclean."

When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the bottom: "Dictated but not read." I was quite impressed. I felt that the writer must be very big and busy and important. I wasn't the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with the words: "Dictated but not read."

He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me with this scribbled across the bottom: "Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners." True, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the hurt he had given me.

If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism- no matter how certain we are that it is justified.

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest novelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.

Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was
made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? "I will speak ill of no man," he said, " . . and speak all the good I know of everybody."

Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do.

But it takes character and self-control to be under-standing and forgiving.

"A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men."

Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent per-former at air shows, was returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged although nobody was hurt.

Hoover's first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane's fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.

Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.

You can imagine Hoover's anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn't scold the mechanic; he didn't even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man's shoulder and said, "To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow."

Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would expect me to say "don't." But I will not, I am merely going to say, "Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism, 'Father Forgets.' " It originally appeared as an editorial in the People's
Home Journnl. We are reprinting it here with the author's permission, as condensed in the Reader's Digest:

"Father Forgets" is one of those little pieces which- dashed of in a moment of sincere feeling - strikes an echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perenial reprint favorite. Since its first appearance, "Father Forgets" has been reproduced, writes the author, W, Livingston Larned, "in hundreds of magazines and house organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign languages. I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school, church, and lecture platforms. It has been 'on the air' on countless occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to 'click.' This one certainly did."

FATHER FORGETS W. Livingston Larned

Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.

There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.

At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"

Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated
you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive - and if you had to

buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!

Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. "What is it you want?" I snapped.

You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.

Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding - this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.

And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bed-side in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!

It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: "He is nothing but a boy - a little boy!"

I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much,
too much.

Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. "To know all is to forgive all."

As Dr. Johnson said: "God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days."

Why should you and I?
