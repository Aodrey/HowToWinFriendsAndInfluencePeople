How This Book Was Written-And Why
どのように、そしてどうしてこの本を書いたか

by Dale Carnegie

During the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the publishing houses of America printed more than a fifth of a million different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were financial failures. "Many," did I say? The president of one of the largest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his company, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost money on seven out of every eight books it published.

20世紀始めの25年の間、米国の出版社は500万冊以上もの本を出版しました。そのほとんどがひどく退屈なもので、商業上失敗に終わっています。「ほとんど」と僕が言ったことに疑問ですか？　ある世界規模の出版社の社長が、僕に対して打ち明けたんですよ、75年の出版経験を経ても、未だに8冊出版するうちの7冊分は赤字なのだと。

Why, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after I had written it, why should you bother to read it?

ではなぜ、僕が無謀にももう一冊本を書いたのか、そして僕が書き終えたら、読者の皆さんはなぜわざわざ読まされるのか？

Fair questions, both; and I'll try to answer them.

両方とも最もな質問ですね。この質問にお答えしましょう。

I have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business and professional men and women in New York. At first, I conducted courses in public speaking only - courses designed to train adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before groups.
僕は1912年からずっと、ニューヨークで事業や専門職種にある人のための教育講座を運営しています。最初はスピーチの講座だけをやっていました。大人向けの訓練として構成したこの講座は、面接からスピーチまで対応していたのですが、実際に体験してもらうことで、即興で考えることと、その内容を明確、効果的かつ安定した表現をすることを目的としていました。

# think on one's feet = すぐに決断する

But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social contacts.

ですが次第に、講座を重ねるにしたがって、受講者は「使える」話し方の練習が必要であると痛感しました。日々の仕事や人づきあいの上でうまくやる上での、高度な技術を訓練する必要があったのです。

# 受講生が必要としていた訓練のレベルが、講座の最初の目的よりも低かったということか？

I also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training myself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such as this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless boon it would have been.

僕がもう一つ、だんだんと痛感してきたのが、僕自身にもそういう訓練が必要だってことです。この数年間を振り返ると、自分自身の手腕や理解がしょっちゅう不足していることにがくぜんとするんです。20年前にこんな本があったらとどんなに良かったことか！とんでもないお宝になったことでしょう。

Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer.

人付き合いをうまくすることは、皆さんが直面するもっとも大きな課題でしょう。特に仕事上では。そう、家庭の主婦でも、建築家でも技師でもこの問題は同じなのです。

Research done a few years ago under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering-to personality and the ability to lead people.

カーネギー教育振興財団 (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching)賛助のもとで数年前に行われた調査は、非常に重大で意義深い事実を明らかにしました。その事実はのちにカーネギー工科大学（Carnegie Institute of Technology）の追加研究によって裏付けられたものです。この調査は、エンジニアのような工業系の職業であっても、金銭的に成功した人の15%は技術知識によるものですが、85%は人間工学のスキル、つまり人柄や指導力によるものであるということを明らかにしたのです。

For many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes. They came to me because they had finally realized, after years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people-that person is headed for higher earning power.

長年にわたり、僕はフィラデルフィア技術者クラブ（the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia）で毎期にわたり講座の指導をしました。それに、アメリカ電気学会ニューヨーク支部（the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers）でも講座を教えました。あわせるとおそらく1500人以上のエンジニアが僕の生徒になったことになります。彼らが僕の授業を取ったのは、何年かの観測と経験によって、やっと「最も稼ぐエンジニアのほとんどは、技術知識がある人ではない」ということに気づいたからです。たとえば、仕事上での技術能力、計算能力、設計能力などの専門性が優れた人が普通の給料で雇われたとしましょう。でも技術知識にプラスして考えを表現したり、リーダーシップを取ったり、人から大きな関心を持たれたりするような人はどうでしょうか。そんな人はもっと稼いでいくわけです。

In the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that "the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee." "And I will pay more for that ability," said John D., "than for any other under the sun."

ジョン・ロックフェラーは全盛期に言いました。「人付き合いの技術は砂糖やコーヒーといった日用品みたいに買えるものだ。」「そしてわたしはその技術に、ほかのありとあらゆるものよりも多く支払おう」と。

Wouldn't you suppose that every college in the land would conduct courses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if there is just one practical, common-sense course of that kind given for adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my attention up to the present writing.

みなさんは、この国の全部の大学が、高給取りになれるありとあらゆる技能を習得する講座を開講しているにちがいないと思ってるのではないでしょうか？しかしこの国でたった1講座でも、人付き合いの技能を知りたい社会人のための実践的な講座が開講されていれば、僕が前に書いた本は見向きもされなかったでしょうね。

The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted a survey to determine what adults want to study.

That survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to answer 156 questions-questions such as "What is your business or profession? Your education? How do you spend your spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are you most interested in studying?" And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.

この調査には2万5千ドルをかけ、2年間にわたり行われました。調査の最後はコネティカット州メリデンでした。典型的なアメリカの町が選出されました。メリデンに住む成人一人ひとりが面接を受け、156もの質問を受けました。質問は「あなたの仕事や専門は何ですか？どんな教育を受けましたか？休日は何をしていますか？収入は？趣味は？夢は？悩みは？勉強するなら何の科目がいいですか？」といった具合です。この調査でわかったのは、成人が最も興味を持っていることは健康で、2番目に興味を持っていることは人だったのです。人というのは、他人を理解したり他人とうまくやっていく方法、人に好かれる方法、そして他人を自分の考えの味方につける方法などです。

So the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a course for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found-not one. Finally they approached one of the world's outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of this group. "No," he replied, "I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never been written."

I knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had been searching for years to discover a practical, working handbook on human relations.

Since no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own courses. And here it is. I hope you like it.

In preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the subject- everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the new psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries reading everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had dealt with people. We read their biographies, We read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the
ages for winning friends and influencing people.

I personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them world-famous-inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen D. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and explorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover the techniques they used in human relations.

From all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it "How to Win Friends and Influence People." I say "short." It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.

I gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then come back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting assignment! These men and women, hungry for self- improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a new kind of laboratory - the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.

This book wasn't written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a child grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.

Years ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger than a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After fifteen years of experiment and research came this book.

The rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives of many people.

To illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses. For years, he had driven and criticized and condemned his employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and encouragement
were alien to his lips. After studying the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply altered his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team- work. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech before the class: "When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees actually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But now they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first name."

This employer gained more profit, more leisure and -what is infinitely more important-he found far more happiness in his business and in his home.

Countless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by the use of these principles. Many have opened up new accounts - accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been given increased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase in salary because he applied these truths. Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he was sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This training not only saved him from the demotion but brought him a promotion with increased pay.

On innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the end of the course have told me that their homes have been much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.

People are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all seems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn't wait forty-eight hours to report their achievements at the regular session of the course.

One man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into the night discussing them with other members of the class. At three o'clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a realization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a
new and richer world opening before him, that he was unable to sleep. He didn't sleep that night or the next day or the next night.

Who was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any new theory that came along? No, Far from it. He was a sophisticated, blasé dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages fluently and was a graduate of two European universities.

While writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old school, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written from a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.

Another man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man, the owner of a large carpet factory, declared he had learned more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of influencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his four years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish. I am merely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently successful Harvard graduate in a public address to approximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the evening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.

"Compared to what we ought to be," said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, "compared to what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use,"

Those powers which you "habitually fail to use"! The sole purpose of this book is to help you discover, develop and profit by those dormant and unused assets,

"Education," said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton University, "is the ability to meet life's situations,"

If by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of this book- if you aren't then a little better equipped to meet life's situations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far as you are concerned. For "the great aim of education," said Herbert Spencer, "is not knowledge but action."

And this is an action book.
